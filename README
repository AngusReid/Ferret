Ferret: An optimized substring search engine written in Go.
Makes use of a combination of an Inverted Index and a Suffix Array to allow log-time lookups with a very small memory footprint.
Also incorporates error-correction (Levenshtein distance 1) and simple Unicode-to-ASCII conversion.

Check out example.go for example usage. The code is meant to be as fast as possible for a substring dictionary search, and as such is best suited for large dictionaries with >1,000,000 total characters. I've timed 20s initialization for 3.5 million characters on a modern CPU (350,000 entries), and 200us search time (3ms with error-correction).
